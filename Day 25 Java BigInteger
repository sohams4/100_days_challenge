QUESTION: Java BigInteger

In this problem, you have to add and multiply huge numbers! These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.

Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.

Input Format

There will be two lines containing two numbers,  and .

Constraints

 and  are non-negative integers and can have maximum  digits.

Output Format

Output two lines. The first line should contain , and the second line should contain . Don't print any leading zeros.

Sample Input

1234
20
Sample Output

1254
24680

SOLUTION: 

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
     BigInteger bi1 = new BigInteger(sc.next());
     BigInteger bi2 = new BigInteger(sc.next());

        BigInteger  bi3, bi4;
        bi3 = bi1.add(bi2);
        bi4 = bi1.multiply(bi2);
        System.out.println( bi3);
        System.out.println( bi4);
    }
}
