QUESTION: Java BigInteger
In this problem, you have to add and multiply huge numbers! These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.

Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.

Input Format

There will be two lines containing two numbers,  and .

Constraints

 and  are non-negative integers and can have maximum  digits.

Output Format

Output two lines. The first line should contain , and the second line should contain . Don't print any leading zeros.

Sample Input

1234
20
Sample Output

1254
24680

SOLUTION:
import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
   Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
   BigInteger a = new BigInteger(sc.nextLine());
    BigInteger b = new BigInteger(sc.nextLine());
    System.out.println(a.add(b));
    System.out.println(a.multiply(b));
    }
    
}
