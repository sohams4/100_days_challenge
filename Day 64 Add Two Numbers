QUESTION: Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 

Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

SOLUTION: 

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0); // creating an dummy list
        ListNode curr = dummy; // intialising an pointer
        int carry = 0; // intialising our carry with 0 intiall
        // while loop will run, until l1 OR l2 not reaches null OR if they both reaches null. But our carry has some value in it. 
		// We will add that as well into our list
        while(l1 != null || l2 != null || carry == 1){
            int sum = 0; // intialising our sum
            if(l1 != null){ // adding l1 to our sum & moving l1
                sum += l1.val;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }
            if(l2 != null){ // adding l2 to our sum & moving l2
                sum += l2.val;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            sum += carry; // if we have carry then add it into our sum
            carry = sum/10; // if we get carry, then divide it by 10 to get the carry
            ListNode node = new ListNode(sum % 10); // the value we'll get by moduloing it, will become as new node so. add it to our list
            curr.next = node; // curr will point to that new node if we get
            curr = curr.next; // update the current every time
        }
        return dummy.next; // return dummy.next bcz, we don't want the value we have consider in it intially!!
    }
}
